## TECHNOLOGIES USED
The application is built in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a [Python-based](https://www.python.org/downloads/) framework with its own template language, and uses [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the user end of the application. The app was published on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## WIREFRAME
The application was always panned to be a single-page web application; this wireframe was created in [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/).

## USER STORIES
As a user I’d like:
—  to be able to select a die and have the computer roll it for me.
— to select multiples of different kinds of dice and have the computer roll and add their results together.

## APPROACH TAKEN
[Bella](https://github.com/BellaMalo1) and [I](https://github.com/Rancor38) began this project to work in Django, and planned to build the application using their framework. We got started with user stories (see above) and built a wireframe in Google Slides to flesh out the concept. We collaborated with each other every step of the way using [Discord](https://discord.com/) to share screens remotely as well as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to pair-program with their liveshare feature.

The most challenging steps were, setting up Django to the stage were we could template, and deployment. The rest was using the django templating language and javascript for dice-rolling logic which wasn't too difficult. All together, a great success, and I look forward to my next project!
